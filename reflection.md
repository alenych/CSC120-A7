Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

1. Library:
    - 1. Overloaded checkOut method that allows two books to be checked out at once


    - 2. Overloaded returnBook method that allows two books to be returned at once

2. Cafe:

    - Overloaded coffee sale method that only offers black coffees, takes in coffee amount and cups only

    - Overloaded restock that only restocks coffee and cups

3. House:
    - 1. Overloaded moveIn method that states the floor a resident moves to 

    - 2. Overloaded moveOut method that states the floor a resident moves to



- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

- My overloaded methods improved the usability and functionality of the House, Library, and cafe classes, allowing for more flexible and efficient operations that are more aligned with potential real-world use cases, such as initializing with predefined data or handling bulk operations efficiently. I would advise really thinking about efficiency of code in the real world for this assignment.
